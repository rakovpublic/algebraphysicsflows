I think that the most valuable breakthrough for modern physics  can be description of mechanism which allow to be the particles members of one "entity"/"math" and regestration of "operations which moves to other math"/wave function collapse. I think that phycists can achive it just reviewing what interactions are playing role observerv for different particles.
